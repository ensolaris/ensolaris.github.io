## Welcome to my very first personal webpage on the Internet 

### Who am I? 

```
My name is Evgeniia, and I'm a newbie in programming. 
In my ordinary life I work as a group head for an advertising agency. This agency is pretty big and famous, btw. 
Well, although my career path is in digital marketing domain, I'm someone very curious, and learning programming was my sweet dream for a long time. Well, since Feb'22 I've been learning Python. Now I'm doing that for fun, mostly. But my goal is to start working as a beckend developer in the future.
